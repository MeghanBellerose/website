title: Role of health insurance and healthcare costs in perinatal decision-making and well-being among women with disabilities

---

Through qualitative, in-depth interviews, I try to understand 1) How women with disabilities in the United States navigate decisions regarding health insurance and healthcare costs before, during, and after pregnancy? and 2) In what ways do health insurance policies facilitate or restrict use of desired perinatal care by women with disabilities?
