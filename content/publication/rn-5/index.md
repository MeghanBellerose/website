summary: Medicaid claims data are a useful source of information on health care use during the postpartum period; however, results from this cross-sectional study suggest that estimates of postpartum visit use derived from Medicaid claims may undercount postpartum visit receipt by systematically missing care received by unqualified immigrants with Emergency Medicaid for delivery and those who transition to private insurance during the postpartum period. These findings suggest that accounting for postpartum insurance transitions when conducting studies using Medicaid claims data may improve estimates of postpartum health care use and outcomes.
