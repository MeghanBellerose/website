      title: Dissertation
      text: |-
        My dissertation examines the impact of health insurance coverage policies on reproductive and pregnancy care use among women with disabilities in the United States. This work is funded by an F31 Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Individual National Research Award from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD).

        In **Chapter 1**, I evaluate the impact of Medicare’s limited coverage of contraceptive methods on contraceptive use among women  with disabilities. Medicare provides health insurance to nearly 1.5 million reproductive-aged women with disabilities. Unlike commercial health insurance plans, TRICARE, and Medicaid, which are required to cover all forms of contraception without cost-sharing, Medicare does not cover permanent contraceptives for pregnancy prevention and offers limited coverage of long- and short-acting methods. Individuals who are simultaneously enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid due to a combination of low-income and disability (“dual enrollees”) receive contraceptive coverage through Medicaid. In this paper, I use national 2016-2020 Traditional Medicare (TM), Medicare Advantage (MA), and Medicaid claims to describe differences in contraceptive use between women with disabilities enrolled in TM, MA, Medicaid, dual enrolled with TM, and dual enrolled with MA. I then examine the causal impact of gaining contraceptive coverage through new dual enrollment on contraceptive use among Medicare enrollees with disabilities using a propensity score-weighted staggered-entry difference-in-differences approach. I find that gaining contraceptive coverage through dual enrollment increases overall contraceptive use and use individual short- and long-acting contraceptive methods, suggesting that Medicare’s coverage policies are a barrier to desired contraceptive use.

        In **Chapter 2**, I examine two potential drivers of disparities in pregnancy care use between women with and without disabilities and women with disabilities enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid: perinatal care fragmentation, meaning the spread of visits across clinicians and the share of visits provided by each clinician, and out-of-pocket costs.

        In **Chapter 3**, I use qualitative, in-depth interviews to understand the role of health insurance and healthcare costs in perinatal decision-making and well-being among women with disabilities. My research questions are: 1) How do women with disabilities in the United States navigate decisions regarding health insurance and healthcare costs before, during, and after pregnancy? and 2) In what ways do health insurance policies facilitate or restrict use of desired perinatal care by women with disabilities?
